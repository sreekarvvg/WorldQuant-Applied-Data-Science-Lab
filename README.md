8-end-to-end Guided Data Science Projects

I have currently completed 5/8 projects, and will soon post my certification after completing all 8 projects.

I am documenting my journey and am currently in the process of completing all eight projects at WorldQuant's Data Science Program, a transformative journey that has broadened my skills and knowledge in the field of data science! 🎓 ✨

Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to work on fascinating projects, each designed to enhance my understanding and practical application of key data science concepts. Let me provide a brief explanation of each project:

1- 𝗛𝗢𝗨𝗦𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗜𝗡 𝗠𝗘𝗫𝗜𝗖𝗢: Learners use a dataset of 21,000 properties to determine if real estate prices are influenced more by property size or location. They import and clean data from a CSV file, build data visualizations, and examine the relationship between two variables using correlation.

2- 𝗔𝗣𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗠𝗘𝗡𝗧 𝗦𝗔𝗟𝗘𝗦 𝗜𝗡 𝗕𝗨𝗘𝗡𝗢𝗦 𝗔𝗜𝗥𝗘𝗦: Learners build a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Argentina. They create a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and they improve model performance by reducing overfitting.

3- 𝗔𝗜𝗥 𝗤𝗨𝗔𝗟𝗜𝗧𝗬 𝗜𝗡 𝗡𝗔𝗜𝗥𝗢𝗕𝗜: Learners build an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Kenya. They extract data from a MongoDB database using Pymongo and improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

4- 𝗘𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗛𝗤𝗨𝗔𝗞𝗘 𝗗𝗔𝗠𝗔𝗚𝗘 𝗜𝗡 𝗡𝗘𝗣𝗔𝗟: Learners build logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings. They extract data from a SQLite database and reveal the biases in data that can lead to discrimination.

5- 𝗕𝗔𝗡𝗞𝗥𝗨𝗣𝗧𝗖𝗬 𝗜𝗡 𝗣𝗢𝗟𝗔𝗡𝗗: Learners build random forest and gradient boosting models to predict whether a company will go bankrupt. They navigate the Linux command line, address imbalanced data through resampling, and consider the impact of performance metrics precision and recall.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to WorldQuant for providing an exceptional learning experience. The program's comprehensive curriculum and hands-on projects have equipped me with practical skills and a deep understanding of data science techniques.
